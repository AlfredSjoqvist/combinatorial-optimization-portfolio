The heuristic does well that it picks the factory with the lowest cost and 
then based on that factory it will give all of its resources to as many 
customers as possible (in the cheapest oreder). There's major flaws
    1. It only looks on the cheapest price for the factory, not on the "roads"
        to the customers when choosing the factory to place.
    2. When the factory is chosen it will give all of its supply, without 
        concidering that there might be cheaper options with a new factory and
        with its own set of roads.

The heuristic is more suitable to calculating the best way to place factories, 
therefore if the "roads" have similar cost for all factories, it will give a
good estimation. 

The heuristic is very bad if the factory prices would be similar but the roads
would have a large difference in price.
